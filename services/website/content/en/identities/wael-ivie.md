Hi, I am Wael Ivie, my partner and I run [PIADA](/en/stake-pools/b8d8742c7b7b512468448429c776b3b0f824cef460db61aa1d24bc65.md) stake pool, I am the founder of the Armada Alliance, and the ARMing Cardano proposal from fund4 of project Catalyst. My whole life I, have been wondering, "how can I help the world be a better place"? I have decided to do this by focusing my efforts on decentralization and blockchain education. Part of my mission with blockchain technology and Cardano is to help bring about a true change in the way the world's industries and society operate by advocating for true decentralization and sustainability.
