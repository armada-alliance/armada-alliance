Primarily interested in energy efficient Off The Grid pool operations. I enjoy testing, helping & writing guides so others can work toward building a truly decentralized network.

The mission is to protect everyones investment by having succesful pools on baremetal all around the world. Helping SPO's & talking heads understand that datacenters are the enemy, centralized and a point of failure.

Then having a community in place to guide & support them.


I fix stuff and the network is nowhere near resilient enough. Please help me spread awareness.
