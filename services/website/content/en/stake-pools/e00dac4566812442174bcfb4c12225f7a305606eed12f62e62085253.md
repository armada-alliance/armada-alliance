## Our Mission

WottleNFT was born in May 2021 with a mission to create a global interconnected ecosystem between Cardano NFTs and Social Enterprises to drive the world towards a brighter and sustainable future. WottleNFT values resonate well with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which is ingrained into our business model. We decided to support social enterprises because we recognise their struggle for good. Furthermore, social enterprises have their own business models that are aligned with SDGs. By supporting social enterprises, we are helping them to deliver a stronger, continuous sustainable impact in their business.

We can help social enterprises together, starting now. You can do so simply by staking your ADA to [WOT]. By supporting WottleNFT, you are supporting social enterprises, as 20% of [WOT]'s rewards will be channeled towards Social Enterprises of the community's choice! As a reward, delegators who stake a minimum of 1000 ADA will receive our very first and exclusive utility NFT drop by the end of the year. More information will be released soon! Thank you for supporting us!
